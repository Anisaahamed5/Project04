Paper Trading App

## Name

Anisa Ahamed

## Description

This app credits the user with an initial balance of fake money. Users are able to trade stocks as well as view stock trends. 


## User Stories

1. A user wants to get involved in the stock market, but wants to practice trading with pretend money before trading with real money.
2. A user wants to teach their child about stocks, so they teach them to trade money with the pretend money on the app.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, jQuery, Python, Django, 

## Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Instead of using an API, I would use an SDK to have a greater variety of content.
2. I would improve the homepage and add preview GIFS to the index.html.
